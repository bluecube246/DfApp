This application uses Korean BERT to hep users get image and information about a dungeon & fighter character. The users input is extracted using the google speech api. Then the speech goes into an NLU model extracting the slot and intents. The extracted slots and intents are used to call the dungeon & fighter open API to get the relevant results.
